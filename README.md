# MEAN MES

MEAN is a boilerplate that provides a nice starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you quick and organized way to start developing of MEAN based web apps with useful modules like mongoose and passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.  

## It is a simple [MEAN](http:mean.io) based 'manufacturing execution system' in other words -- 'workshop management system' project.
